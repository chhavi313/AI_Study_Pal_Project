Artificial Intelligence Capstone Project - Final Report (Summary)

Project: AI Study Pal
Objective: Build a simple, believable AI-powered study assistant covering study plans, quiz generation, summarization, and tips. The focus is on demonstration of concepts rather than production-ready systems.

Core modules (designed):
- Data cleaning and visualization (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- ML quiz generator (logistic regression, k-means clustering)
- DL summarizer (Keras-based prototype)
- NLP tips extractor (NLTK)
- Flask web interface to tie modules together

Deliverables included in this submission:
- Project scaffold and documentation (this repo)
- Placeholder frontend and backend descriptions
- Java module placeholder
- Original project brief (PDF)

Evaluation notes:
This scaffold is ready for demonstration and can be extended later to include runnable code; instructors can evaluate the design, datasets, model choices, and planned evaluation metrics from the included documentation.
