# app_placeholder.md

This file describes the intended Flask app endpoints and behaviour for demonstration / evaluation.

Endpoints:
- / -> homepage (templates/index.html)
- /api/generate_plan -> accepts subject/hours, returns a JSON study plan
- /api/generate_quiz -> returns a generated quiz (5 questions)
- /api/summarize -> returns shortened text summary
- /api/tips -> returns study tips extracted from input text

Note: The code to run these endpoints is intentionally omitted in this submission (instructor asked for a project package only).
